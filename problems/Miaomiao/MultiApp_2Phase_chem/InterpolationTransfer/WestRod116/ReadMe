There are different attemptions to find the vapor thickness in sub_5th_rod116.i:

6.4 microns --> 7.0 microns --> 7.5 microns --> 7.8 microns --> 8.2 microns
failed      --> failed      --> failed	    --> failed      --> done!



For singlephase scenario, I calculated under no Adaptivity condition. Just so I know, with Adaptivity, the result could be very different, and the calculation costs much more time.


Without adaptivity, I tried to change the mesh size of the domain. Strange thing happened: 
nx = 25
ny = 50 
dt = 1e-1 

nx = 40
ny = 80
dt = 1e-1

These two give me quite different result. (The former is much quicker than the latter).
